> This mini-project aims to highlight the process of transforming a code initially written in C into a more intricate low-level language known as assembly language. <br>
In this instance, I employed the MIPS ISA to accomplish this conversion, offering a glimpse into the fusion of high-level coding and low-level intricacy.
